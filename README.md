A directed graph implementation using linked adjacency lists to represent flight paths between cities. This project provides functionality to construct a graph of cities as vertices, add directed edges between departure and arrival locations, and remove existing flight connections. The implementation uses a City node-based structure where each city maintains a linked list of its outgoing flights, making it efficient for sparse graph representations typical in airline route networks.
